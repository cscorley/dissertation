Here's what I know.

# TODO

- Write a "rolling synopsis" to help organize that thought, perhaps send it to
  Nick & Carver ASAP. (Authoring pg 53)
- Reorg so each chapter addresses one topic. The mixed thing right now is bad.
- Possibly split up the combination chapter (after reorg) into two separate
  ones.  It seems there's plenty of need to separate model optimization and
  corpus optimization given how much data I have.

# Synopsis
