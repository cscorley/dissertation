## Modeling changeset topics {#mud2014}

This section discusses the work in @Corley-etal:2014.

### Terminology

In addition to the terminology described in Section \ref{terminology}, we
use the following terminology to describe document extraction of changesets.

diff:
:   set of text which represents the differences between two texts

patch:
:   a set of instructions (i.e., diffs) that is used to transform one set of
texts into another

context lines:
:   lines of a diff that denote text useful for transforming the text, but do
not represent the differences

added lines:
:   lines of a diff that were *added* in order to transform the first text into
the second

removed lines:
:   lines of a diff that were *removed* in order to transform the first text into
the second

changeset
:   ideally represents a single feature modification, addition, or deletion,
which may crosscut many source code entities

commit
:   a representation of a changeset in a version control system, such as Git or
Subversion.

### Approach

- Document extraction
- Preprocessing
- Training
- Retrieval

\caption{Example of a \texttt{git diff}}
Black or blue lines denote metadata about the change useful for patching.
In particular, black lines represent context lines (beginning with a single space).
Red lines (beginning with a single~\texttt{-}) denote line removals,
and green lines (beginning with a single~\texttt{+}) denote line additions.
