# Proposed work

In this chapter, I outline the proposed work and methodologies to be used for
each. First, I will cover work on the application of topic models for feature
location. I will follow up with work on the application of topic models for
developer identification. Finally, I will discuss an approach which can use a
singular topic model for both of these tasks.
