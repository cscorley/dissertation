# Conclusion and Future Work {#conclusion}

In this proposal I present work that fundamentally changes the approach
researchers and practitioners take when using topic modeling for automating
software maintenance tasks. Namely, I plan to investigate the effectiveness of
topic modeling changesets for two tasks: feature location and developer
identification. Further, this approach will allow for using a single topic
model for both tasks, potentially removing the retraining cost associated with
topic modeling and the need for a dedicated model for each task.

Appendix \ref{projected-schedule} and \ref{target-venues} contain a general
schedule and submission outline. For the first research problem, using
changeset-based FLTs, the work is nearing completion. I have submitted the
first paper on this work to the 2015 International Conference on Software
Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME), the most related venue for the work.

The second work, using a changeset-based DIT, is underway. Unfortunately, all
deadlines for conferences related to this work are in the Fall, with the
exception of the International Conference on Automated Software Engineering
(ASE). The ASE deadline for 2015 is in early May, which makes it a difficult
target, although not impossible.

The third work, combining the use of a topic model in an FLT and DIT, is much
broader and will fit better in a long-form journal, such as the Journal of
Software: Evolution and Process (JSEP). Unfortunately, again, the publication
of this will need to wait until we address the first two research problems.
This will potentially delay publication of this work until 2016.
