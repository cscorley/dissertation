# Conclusion and Future Work {#conclusion}

welp, here's what went well/wrong, and what to try next.

## Feature Location
## Developer Identification
## Combining and Configuring Changset-based Topic Models
## Future Work

TODO:

- Need to look at closer at online parameters
- Replicate to a "temporal" snapshot evaluation -- will take time
- Replicate to other online models -- LSI, D2V when possible
- Language models (trained on N Java projects) vs single-project models
- This work allows for models to take in streams of data, e.g., from Github, to
create models that can be used in general cases.
