# Introduction

Software developers are often confronted with maintenance tasks that involve
navigation of repositories that preserve vast amounts of project history.
Navigating these software repositories can be a time-consuming task, because
their organization can be difficult to understand. Fortunately, topic models
such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [@Blei-etal_2003] can help developers
to navigate and understand software repositories by discovering topics (word
distributions) that reveal the thematic structure of the data
[@Linstead-etal_2007; @Thomas-etal_2011; @Hindle-etal_2012].

Program comprehension is a prerequisite to incremental change. A software
developer who is tasked with changing a large software system spends effort on
program comprehension activities to gain the knowledge needed to make the
change [@Corbi_1989]. For example, the developer spends effort to understand
the system architecture or to locate the parts of the source code that
implement the feature(s) being changed. Gaining such knowledge can be a
time-consuming task, especially for developers who are unfamiliar with the
system. Topic models of source code can help such developers to understand the
system by revealing a latent structure that is not obvious from the package
hierarchy or system documentation [@Savage-etal_2010].

Topic models are used to uncover thematic structure (e.g., topics) of source
code entities that are grouped by their natural language content (i.e., the
words in their identifiers, comments, and literals). Such topics often
correspond to the concepts and features implemented by the source code
[@Baldi-etal_2008], and exploring such topics shows promise in helping
developers to understand the entities that make up a system and to understand
how those entities relate [@Kuhn-etal_2007; @Maskeri-etal_2008;
@Savage-etal_2010; @Gethers-etal_2011a]. Recent approaches to exploring
linguistic topics in source code use machine learning techniques that model
correlations among words, such as latent semantic indexing (LSI)
[@Deerwester-etal_1990] and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
[@Blei-etal_2003], and ML techniques that also model correlations among
documents, such as RTM [@Chang-Blei_2010].

Topic models of source code have many applications in addition to general
program comprehension. These applications include feature location
[@Dit-etal_2013a], bug localization [@Lukins-etal_2008; @Rao-etal_2013],
triaging incoming change requests [@Kagdi-etal_2012], traceability link
recovery [@Asuncion-etal_2010], and several other areas [@Biggers_2012]. Yet,
while researchers have had success in using topic models on source code
entities, there is a fundamental issue with the current approaches. This issue
is that the input documents used to build a topic model are often source code
entities, and will be the motivating point of this work.
