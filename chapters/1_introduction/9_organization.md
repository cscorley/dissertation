## Organization {#sec:intro-organization}

The organization of this work is as follows.  Chapter \ref{chap:related}
discusses related work in the area of text retrieval, configuration, and
applications in software maintenance. Chapters \ref{chap:flt}, \ref{chap:dit}
present our approach applied to the two tasks of Feature Location and Developer
Identification, respectively.  Chapter \ref{chap:combo} investigates whether
combining the two tasks is possible using a changeset-based approach.  Finally,
in Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} we conclude and describe future directions for
this work.
