## Research Goals, Questions, and Hypotheses {#thesis-goals}

The primary research goal of this proposal is to evaluate the performance and
reliability of topic models built on the source code histories. This will
require configuring and executing studies in various contexts of software
maintenance work, such as feature location and developer identification.

A secondary goal is to create a practical framework for building models that
can be used in multiple contexts. This will require building a prototype tool
that could be used by both researchers and practitioners.

Towards achieving these goals, I've identified three core research questions,
defined below.

Research Question 1
:   How does training a topic model on changesets affect the performance of a
topic-modeling-based feature location techinque?

Research Question 2
:   How does training a topic model on changesets affect the performance of a
topic-modeling-based developer identification techinque?

Research Question 3
:   Can a single topic model trained on changesets be effectively used in both
feature location and developer identification techniques?

Essentially, we want to know whether using changesets in a topic-modeling-based
tool is beneficial and whether we can use multiple tools on the same topic
model. The former is targeted by RQ1 and RQ2, and the latter by RQ3.
