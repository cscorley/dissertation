## Terminology {#sec:intro-terminology}

This section defines some of the terminology seen throughout this work.
We adopt and extend terminology from @Biggers-etal_2014. In particular, we
define the following:

feature location
:   the act of identifying the source code entity or entities implementing a
feature

developer identification
:   the act of identifying the developer most apt to completing a software
maintenance task

query, $q$
:   a document created by a user

term (word), $w$
:   the smallest free-form of a language

token
:   a sequence of non-whitespace characters containing one or more term

entity
:   a named source element such as a method, class, or package

identifier
:   a token representing the name of an entity

comment
:   a sequence of tokens delimited by language specific markers (e.g., `/* */`
or `#`)

literal
:   a sequence of tokens delimited by language specific markers (e.g., `' '`
for strings)

document, $d$
:   a sequence of $D$ terms $w_1, w_2, ..., w_D$, often represented as a
bag of words (i.e., $M$-length vector of term frequencies or weights)

corpus, $C$
:   a sequence of $N$ documents $d_1, d_2, ..., d_N$ (i.e., a $M \times N$
term-document matrix)

vocabulary, $V$
:   a set of $M$ unique terms that appear in a corpus $\{w_1, w_2, ..., w_M\}$

topic, $z$
:   a concept or theme of related terms, often represented as a distribution of
term proportions

topic model, $\phi$
:   a mathematical representation of the thematic structure of a corpus, or how
much a term $w$ contributes to each topic $z$ (i.e., a $K \times M$ topic-term
matrix)

inferrence, $\theta_d$
:   the thematic structure of a given document (i.e., a $K$-length topic
proportion vector)

index, $\theta$
:   a structure optimized for searching, e.g., in LDA by
inferring the thematic structure of each document (i.e., a $N \times K$
document-topic matrix)

search engine
:   ranks documents by their similarity to a query

diff
:   set of text which represents the differences between two texts (see Figure
\ref{fig:diff})

patch
:   a set of instructions (i.e., diffs) used to transform one set of texts into
another

context lines
:   lines of a diff that denote text useful for transforming the text, but do
not represent the differences

added lines
:   lines of a diff that were *added* to transform the first text into the
second

removed lines
:   lines of a diff that were *removed* to transform the first text into the
second

changeset
:   ideally represents a single feature modification, addition, or deletion,
which may crosscut two or more source code entities

version control system (VCS)
:   tool that assists a developer in maintaining software , such as Git or
Subversion

commit
:   a representation of a changeset in a version control system

software repository
:   collection of commits over time which represent the history of a software
project, maintained by a VCS

    shows the commit id, author name, date of commit, and the message
    associated with the change, followed by the actual diff of the change.
    Green lines (beginning with a single~\texttt{+}) denote addition lines, and
