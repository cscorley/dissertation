# Methodology {#chap:methodology}

In this chapter, we describe our approach and the three studies that address
the respective research problems.  We first describe our changeset-based
approach and compare it to the approach of a snapshot-based topic model search
engine.  We then give our reasoning for why changesets may be good choice for a
training corpus.  Then, we discuss the datasets and benchmarks used throughout
this work.  Next, we describe our approach for an application of topic models
for feature location and how it contrasts to the state-of-the-practice.  We
then discuss work on the application of topic models for developer
identification.  Finally, we discuss an approach for using a single topic model
for both of these tasks.
