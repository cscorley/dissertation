\todo{this needs to be re-written to match reality}

In this chapter, we describe our approach and the three studies to address each
research problem.  We will first describe the basic approach of a
snapshot-based topic model search engine, and then give our reasoning for why
changesets may be good choice for a training corpus.  Then, we discuss the
datasets and benchmarks used throughout this work.  Next, we describe our
approach for an application of topic models for feature location and how it
contrasts to the state-of-the-practice.  We then discuss work on the
application of topic models for developer identification.  Finally, we discuss
an approach for using a singular topic model for both of these tasks.
