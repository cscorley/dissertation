# Methodology {#chap:methodology}

In this chapter, I describe my approach and the three studies that address
the respective research problems.  I first describe the changeset-based
approach and compare it to the approach of a snapshot-based topic model search
engine.  I then give my reasoning for why changesets may be good choice for a
training corpus.  Then, I discuss the datasets and benchmarks used throughout
this work.  Next, I describe my approach for an application of topic models
for feature location and how it contrasts to the state-of-the-practice.  I
then discuss work on the application of topic models for developer
identification.  Finally, I discuss an approach for using a single topic model
for both of these tasks.
