# Methodology {#chap:methodology}

In this chapter, we describe our approach and the three studies to address each
research problem.  We will first describe our changeset-based approach and
compare it to the approach of a snapshot-based topic model search engine.  We
then give our reasoning for why changesets may be good choice for a training
corpus.  Then, we discuss the datasets and benchmarks used throughout this
work.  Next, we describe our approach for an application of topic models for
feature location and how it contrasts to the state-of-the-practice.  We then
discuss work on the application of topic models for developer identification.
Finally, we discuss an approach for using a singular topic model for both of
these tasks.
