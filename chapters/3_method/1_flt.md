## old Feature Location


Feature location is a frequent and fundamental activity for a developer tasked
with changing a software system.  Whether a change task involves adding,
modifying, or removing a feature, a developer cannot complete the task without
first locating the source code that implements the feature.  In this section,
we outline an approach for locating features with online topic models.  First,
we describe our motivation and background in Sections \ref{sec:flt-motivation}
and \ref{sec:flt-background}, respectively.  We then describe our study design
in Section \ref{sec:flt-design}.  Finally, we describe the results of the study
(Section \ref{sec:flt-results}) and discuss them in detail (Section
\ref{sec:flt-discussion}).
