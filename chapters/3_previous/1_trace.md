## Traceability link recovery {#tefse2011}

In our first work, @Corley-etal_2011, we investigated automatic recovery of
traceability links from patches attached to bug reports. Previously to this
work, traceability links between an issue report and the methods changed to
resolve that issue could only be extracted by commit messages left behind by
developers in the software repository. Our work enabled for those methods to be
extracted directly from the issue report via the patches attached to the
report.

To evaluate this work, we compared our automated approach to manually extracted
links.
