# Previous Work

This section aims to show what work already completed towards the goals of this
proposal. First, I will talk about traceability link recovery via patch
analysis, an approach which has proven useful for building datasets
[@Moreno-etal_2014]. Then, I will discuss a paper on source code ownership,
which relates to the developer identification problem. I also discuss a paper
on duplicate bug report detection, one of the common steps in triaging incoming
change requests. Finally, I will cover an exploratory study on modeling
changeset topics.
