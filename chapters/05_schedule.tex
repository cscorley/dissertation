    - Feature location
        - Need to cover this since much triaging is based around it
    - Triaging issues
        - Kagdi et al and related
    - Bug localization
        - Rao et al and related
    - Usage expertise?
- Previous work
    - Traceability link recovery
        - Relates because traceability links might be needed for
          evaluation
    - Modeling ownership
    - Modeling changeset topics
- Proposed work
    - 1 Developer identification with changesets
        - Triage for snapshot-based models vs changeset-based models
        - Word vs line diffs
        - Added vs removed line performance
            - Maybe investigate context of the words/lines
    - 2 Corpora stats from GHTorrent repos
        - Can we find a correlation between the words that appear in a
          project over time
        - This would be useful because online lda requires a static
          dictionary size
    - 3 Implementing infinite vocab lda
        - Needed for a real world usage — static dictionary size no
          longer required
    - 4 Combining knowledge from corpora stats and online lda
        - Might be useful if infinite vocab is not a good approach
        - Hashing from Weinberger’09 might be useful here
    - 5 User study
        - Attempt to deploy the recommender in an environment such as
          CAPS
        - Not sure about the feasibility of this
    - 6 Filtering commits
        - Identifying commits which may need filtering
        - Merge commits may not reflect developer knowledge
        - Filtering whitespace-only changes
    - 7 Branching
        - Models may need to split across branches
        - How does branching/merging affect the models?
- Projected schedule
- Conclusion
