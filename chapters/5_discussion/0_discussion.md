subject system and then for the overall results. The threats to the validity
of this work follows.


On using LDA...

However, LDA is known to get "stuck" in local minima [@Binkley-etal_2014] due
to its non-convexity.  Evaluating and comparing techniques based on single runs
does not show whether one is somehow better or more effective than another.  In
order to accurately judge an approach in comparison to another, we must run
multiple experiments to show that one approach typically scores higher than
another.  This allows for us to eliminate outlier results in order to create a
more fair comparison.


[@Huo-etal_2014] finds differences in bug reports (i.e., the queries) written
by experts vs non-experts.  The found statistically significant differences in
all four of their tests while evaluating the VSM-based FLT [@Zhou-etal_2012],
but only one for their DIT, a technique inspired by @Anvik-etal_2006.
