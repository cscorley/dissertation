# Discussion {#chap:discussion}

In this chapter, I will take a more qualitative look at the Results of the
study described in Chapter \ref{chap:results}.  I discuss the findings for
each research question, starting with \fone and \ftwo (\frps), followed by
\done and \dtwo (\drps), and then finally \cone and \ctwo (\crps).  I will
then present a summary of the findings across all three research problems.
Finally, I discuss the threats to validity of the study and my attempts to
mitigate them.
