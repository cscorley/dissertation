# Discussion {#chap:discussion}

In this chapter, we will take a more qualitative look at the Results of the
study described in Chapter \ref{chap:results}.  We discuss our findings for
each research question, starting with \fone and \ftwo (\frps), followed by
\done and \dtwo (\drps), and then finally \cone and \ctwo (\crps).  We will
then present a summary of our findings across all three research problems.
Finally, we discuss the threats to validity of our study and our attempts to
mitigate them.
