# Discussion {#chap:discussion}

In this chapter, we will take a more qualitative look at the Results of the
study described in Chapter \ref{chap:results}.  We discuss our findings for
each research question, starting with \fone and \ftwo (\frps), followed by
\done and \dtwo (\drps), and then finally \cone and \ctwo (\crps).  We will
then discuss the threats to validity of our study and how we attempted to
mitigate them.
