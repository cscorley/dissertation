## Discussion {#sec:flt-discussion}

The results outlined in the previous section (\ref{sec:flt-results}) warrants
some qualitative discussion.  In particular, our analysis shows significant
affects between snapshots and changesets, and between batch changesets and
changesets in the simulated environment.  The results are mixed between each
and are not conclusive.  However, we argue this is desirable to show that the
accuracy of a changeset-based FLT is similar to that of a snapshot-based FLT
but without the retraining cost.

\input{figures/flt/rq1_overview}

Figure \ref{fig:flt:rq1:overview} shows the effectiveness measures for files
across all systems. The figure suggests that snapshot-based models and
changeset-based models have similar results overall with changesets performing
slightly better, but does not help to understand how each feature query
performs for each model.  With respect to RQ1, we will investigate the queries
and effectiveness measures between the batch snapshot and batch changesets in
detail.  We will first discuss all systems, and then each subject system in
turn.

For the 775 queries across all systems, 155 queries returns the same
effectiveness measure in both approaches, or about 20.0% of the time.  Of these
155 queries, 139 (17.93%) have an effectiveness measure of 1 (the best possible
measure) for both approaches.

After excluding the 155 queries in which ranks which are the same, 87 (11.2%)
of the remaining 620 queries have effectiveness measures is within 1 rank of
each other.  Likewise, 254 (32.78%) queries have a difference in effectiveness
measure less than or equal to 10.  Finally, 398 (51.4%) have the effectiveness
measure is within 50 ranks of each other.  The remaining 222 queries (28.6%)
perform noticeably different ($> 50$ ranks apart).

### Situations


In this study, we've also asked two research questions which lead to two
distinct comparisons.  First, we compare a batch TM-based FLT trained on the
changesets of a project's history to one trained on the snapshot of source code
entities.  Second, we compare a batch TM-based FLT trained on changesets to a
online TM-based FLT trained on the same changesets over time.  Our results are
mixed between the research questions, hence we end up with four possible
situations; we will now discuss each of these situations in detail.


#### Batch changesets are better than batch shapshot *and* batch changesets are better than changesets in the simulated environment

#### Batch changesets are better than batch shapshot *and* changesets in the simulated environment are better than batch changesets

#### Batch snapshot are better than batch changeset *and* changesets in the simulated environment are better than batch changesets

#### Batch snapshot are better than batch changeset *and* batch changesets are better than changesets in the simulated environment
