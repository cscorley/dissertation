\section{Information Retrieval in Software
Maintenance}\label{information-retrieval-in-software-maintenance}

Software developers are often confronted with maintenance tasks that
involve navigation of repositories that preserve vast amounts of project
history. Navigating these software repositories can be a time-consuming
task, because their organization can be difficult to understand.
Fortunately, topic models such as \abbr{LDA}{latent Dirichlet 
 allocation}\scite{Blei-etal:2003} can help developers to navigate and
understand software repositories by discovering topics (word
distributions) that reveal the thematic structure of the
data\scite{Linstead-etal:2007,Thomas-etal:2011,Hindle_etal:2012}.

When modeling a source code repository, the corpus typically represents
a snapshot of the code. That is, a topic model is often trained on a
corpus that contains documents that represent files from a particular
version of the software. Keeping such a model up-to-date is expensive,
because the frequency and scope of source code changes necessitate
retraining the model on the updated corpus. However, it may be possible
to automate certain maintenance tasks without a model of the complete
source code. For example, when assigning a developer to a change task, a
topic model can be used to associate developers with topics that
characterize their previous changes. In this scenario, a model of the
changesets created by each developer may be more useful than a model of
the files changed by each developer. Moreover, as a typical changeset is
smaller than a typical file, a changeset-based model is less expensive
to keep current than a file-based model.

Toward the goal of automating software maintenance tasks using
changeset-based models, in this paper we qualitatively compare topic
models trained on corpora of changesets to those trained on files. For
our comparison we consider vocabulary measures, which indicate whether
term distributions in the changeset corpora match those in the file
corpora, and topic
distinctness\scite{Wei-etal:2010,Thomas-etal:2011,Chuang-etal:2012},
which measures how distinct one topic in a model is from another. Models
with higher topic distinctness values are desirable, because distinct
topics are more useful in differentiating among the documents in a
corpus than are similar topics.
